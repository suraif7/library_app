Project Overview

Our Android application is a comprehensive library management system designed to streamline the operations of a library. The app features a user-friendly login activity for authentication, followed by a dynamic home activity that serves as a central hub for accessing various functionalities. Users can seamlessly navigate through activities such as book management, including the ability to add, edit, view, and delete book records, facilitated by Java and XML files. Additionally, the app provides functionalities for managing book copies, member details, branch details, lending details, author details, and publisher details, all equipped with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to ensure efficient data management. Each activity is meticulously designed with an intuitive user interface to enhance usability and provide a seamless experience for both administrators and library patrons."
